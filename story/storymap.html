<!--Code for Custom Map, checklist item 6
Alison Cooke
January 25, 2023
this code takes from Google map platform: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/advanced-markers-accessibility
as well as using the template from Simple Maps

This map shows the  route I followed when i went to Iceland each point marked in order of where I went.
Each stop labeled with what attracted me to going there
I also included traffic routes and indicators becasue the trip was taken in a car and in Iceland it is very helpful to know
the conditions of the roads before leaving a major city
